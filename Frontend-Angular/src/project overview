Your challenge is to build out this personal finance app and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

We provide the data in a local data.json file, so use that to populate the content on first load. If you want to take it up a notch, feel free to build this as a full-stack application!

Your users should be able to:

See all of the personal finance app data at-a-glance on the overview page
View all transactions on the transactions page with pagination for every ten transactions
Search, sort, and filter transactions
Create, read, update, delete (CRUD) budgets and saving pots
View the latest three transactions for each budget category created
View progress towards each pot
Add money to and withdraw money from pots
View recurring bills and the status of each for the current month
Search and sort recurring bills
Receive validation messages if required form fields aren't completed
Navigate the whole app and perform all actions using only their keyboard
View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
Bonus: Save details to a database (build the project as a full-stack app)
Bonus: Create an account and log in (add user authentication to the full-stack app)
